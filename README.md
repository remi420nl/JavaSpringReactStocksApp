Frontend interacts also with a stock and News API.

This website is meant to be able to create a fake stock portfolio using real AEX stockmarket data. Users are able to sell and buy stocks in order to establish maximum profit, and therefore compete in an online tournament to get to the first place.

For each stock position a history is being tracked. Users are able to update their profile and leave or join the tournament.

This is a link to the Heroku deployment. The application is deployed into two seperate builds. Startup time can take a few seconds due to enabled sleep mode of the Heruko service after a certain amount of inactivity:
